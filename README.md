## RAAC school information with Pandas, Geocode and Folium
Small Jupter Notebook that uses the .CSV provided on the UK.gov website.

It applies geocode to each entry and will inform you if one doesn't comply.

There is then an interactive map created using Folium to map these school locations on the map and also provides some metadata about the school and its current status regarding RAAC.

## Requirements

- Python3
- Jupyter Notebook

I'd recommend create a Python3 venv and then installing requirements.txt via:

pip install -r requirements.txt
